### Dataset
The `Dataset/` folder contains three key datasets used in this project:
1. **Export Competitiveness Data (`Export COMPET_.csv`)**:
   - Contains data on trade exports and competitiveness for various countries.
   - Includes indicators for export performance and specialization in global markets.
   - Used for generating visualizations on trade flows and economic diversity.

2. **Systemic Risk Data (`Fig2a-avg_exposure.csv`)**:
   - Highlights systemic risk exposure within global supply chains.
   - Contains average exposure metrics for firms and regions to disruptions.
   - Used to visualize cascading effects and vulnerabilities in supply networks.

3. **Economic Complexity Index Data (`multidimensional_eci_data.csv`)**:
   - Provides multidimensional metrics on economic complexity for countries.
   - Includes data on trade sophistication, technological outputs, and industrial diversity.
   - Central to mapping economic complexity and its correlation with resilience.
